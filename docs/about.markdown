My name is Pablo Brochard. I am an engineering student at Télécom SudParis in Évry, France.
I like many things in life. I like hanging out with my friends, playing video games and board games.
I realy enjoy organizing, watching and participating in esport, even if I am not very good at the games I play.
I love music, I listen to many styles like rap, rock and hyperpop. I also play bass and drums.
I am trying to find my place in the video game industry. I have a game developper formation but I would also 
like working in game design or close with esport.
