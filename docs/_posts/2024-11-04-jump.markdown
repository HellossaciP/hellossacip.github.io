# Context :
During my last year of engineering school, I followed a class called Human Machine Interaction. The aim was to understand the importance of the interactions between Human and Machine, especially in video games. The class focused on gamepad controls and user experience. We had to do a 6 week project where the goal was to make a video game that emphasize on controls and game feel.

# The Game :
Jump! is a simple platformer where the player must reach the trophy by using the many abbilities that they have. They can jump, double or triple jump, charge jump, wall jump and run. They also can use the many environement elements to their advantage, like passing through thin platforms, using moving platforms, sliding on ice or going through portals.

# My Role :
I did this project with one of my classmate. We both worked on game design and game developpement. I also worked on graphism, UI/UX and level design.
